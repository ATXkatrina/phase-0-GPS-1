* What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
best-practice questions about committing,

* What still confuses you about Git?

* How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
Interesting. it's difficult to drive while someone else is navigating (navigating is not much better though), and I feel like I'm on the spot and there's a time limit on how long I have to complete an assignment. Lorena was helpful though, and I felt like she was veyr engaged in the process and in trying to help me.
